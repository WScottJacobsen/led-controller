# led-controller
A java desktop application written in Processing for graphics.

Does the math on an array of rgb values to create effects and react to music.

It then sends the array of colors to an arduino that drives an LED strip.

You can compile this with Processing and run it yourself, but I made this for myself so I can't guarentee it will work.
